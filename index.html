    Let's Debug S01 EP01 
A simple C program to divide two numbers

Hope u guys are doin good..let's learn some new tech stuff today.

Please find attached the above code.
We first include our header file "stdio.h".
We then create the divide function with proper return types.
But, a/b will return a floating point value instead of int.
So, make sure you change the code it to float while the returning the value if you want to.
Then, entering the main function, we enter our test cases.
It works well for (10,2), giving 5 as the output.
But, dividing a number by zero would result in a "divide by zero error". So, make sure you enclose it within the try and catch blocks. Include the error producing statement inside the try and include the exception that you want to return, here we use "arithmetic exception". 
In the third test case, we give (5,3). But the code would return 1 as it would convert the floating value 1.66 to 1.
Hope you got some insights about the exception, data types and some basics of c..would meet u in another interesting one..🫰🏻
